# I'm Asa Paparo

Welcome to my website! I'm an undergraduate student at MIT interested in robotics and operating systems.

Currently, I'm working on the autonomous racing subteam of [MIT Motorsports](https://www.fsae.mit.edu/). We're developing a self driving racecar to compete in the upcoming [Formula SAE](https://www.fsaeonline.com/) driverless challenge.

I enjoy diving into rabit holes on interesting technology. Recently, this led to work on [replacing](https://github.com/AngleSideAngle/nix-ros-compat) the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) build and dependency management systems with [Nix](https://nix.dev/) and writing a [tool](https://github.com/AngleSideAngle/YADT) to insert arbitrary development environments into arbitrary containers.

In my free time, I enjoy biking and messing with computers. I'll get to polishing and uploading my dotfiles here eventually.

In high school, I was programming lead for [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team 1155, the [SciBorgs](https://github.com/sciborgs). I occassionally volunteer to help run competitions.
